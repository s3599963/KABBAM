          <p><strong>Aiden </strong><i><font color="gray"> Howdy! I’m Aiden AKA s3875759 I live in lower Victoria I have been working in a warehouse for the last 3 years and I was also studying an IT course through Swinburne in 2018 but I couldn’t finish it because of family issues but shortly after those issues resolved I was excited to once again start studying I am very excited to complete this course and transition into a computer science degree when I have enough credits & experience. I can only speak English but I really want to learn Chinese for the demand and advantages it would give in a business scenario. I can’t think of a personal Fact because I believe I am overwhelmingly average. I thoroughly enjoy riding bikes and I recently bought a nice new Road Bike, so in my very little free time I enjoy riding for fun to enjoy nature and the fresh air. </font></i></p>

        <p><strong>Andrew </strong><i><font color="gray"> G’day, My Name is Andrew or s3876928. Currently I am living in Ararat however pushing myself to move back into Ballarat. I have spent most of my time in school trying out different options through things like work experience and similar programs. I spent most of my time in the last two years of high school coaching the next generation of kids how to play sports, alongside this I also studied to be a personal trainer. My work life has consisted of being a press brake operator for nearly 4 years. My hobbies in more recent times have come down to playing video games, skateboarding and as of recently I have gotten into hydro dipping. Although I have no recognisable experience in the IT industry, I have always had a rather extensive interest extending from early childhood.

       <br> <br> <p><strong>Benedict</strong><i><font color="gray"> Guten Tag! 
I’m Benedict Nicholls AKA s3599963 and I constitute one sixth of the team KABBAM. 
This is my third attempt settling into a University degree. The partial prior two endeavors included a BA of Applied Science and a BA of Psychology. Having no genuine sense of clarity for an endgame is what lead me to cease committing to study.  
  
‘If one does not know to what port one is sailing, no wind is favorable’ - Seneca 
 
Now bearing a sense of direction, I'm confident in perusing future studies in IT or related sector. 
I relish photography, sound design, biographies, stoicism and anything else that may fly into my peripheral view of interest.  I’ve never professionally worked in the IT industry, but I have dabbled with creating websites (although my website for assignment 1 says otherwise). Ripe IT technologies such as blockchain, IoT and Smart Contracts are areas on my radar that I intend to gain further insight into. ”</font></i></p>
       <br> <br> <p><strong>Benjamin</strong><i><font color="gray"> Hey there, my name’s Ben and I'm s3880461. I live in Brisbane, Queensland and I enjoy all things Information Technology. I chose studying the Bachelor of IT at RMIT because of the reputation of the University and because RMIT offers online learning at scale. My last three years of my life have been spent backpacking and doing menial labour jobs (like fruit picking and factory work) but before that I had experience working in IT in a consultant position and also as an amateur. I constitute 1/6th of Team KABBAM! We are an elecetic bunch of students and I’m enjoying the group work. My personal hobbies are reading, hiking, gardening and 3D printing.  

 

My main focus is learning about cybersecurity and evolving technologies such as machine learning, natural language processing and neural networks. </font></i></p>
        <br> <br><p><strong>Kieren </strong><i><font color="gray"> Kieren Aquilina and my student number is s3873296 I have a background of five years in graphic design and have been building computers for about six years. I wanted a career change and so I have begun my studies to obtain a bachelor's in information technology. I fly FPV drones and use that skill for photography and cinematography. My Instagram is turd_fpv. My interests in IT are new technologies in the industry, networking and security, and to learn as much as I can about programming languages, how things work, how and why things do what they do. Our team’s name is KABBAM. 

I wish to pursue a career in cyber security and am using this undergraduate qualification to assist me in getting into my first role in IT where I can gain experience and continue studying to reach my ideal job as an ethical hacker or security analyst. </font></i></p>
       
        <br> <br><p><strong>Marcus</strong><i><font color="gray"> G’day! I’m S3866587 but my mates call me Marcus. 
I have around 7 years of experience working in various IT roles, and recently decided it was time to return to study to gain a qualification relevant to the industry. 
My hobbies include coding, guitar, photography, and distance running. 
I have a keen interest in coding and want to continue to develop and refine my skills so I can continue my pathway towards becoming a frontend developer.
