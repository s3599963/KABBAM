        <h1>Clouds, Services, Servers</h1>
        <p style="margin-top: 30px">
        In 2020 Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud are the leading platforms when it comes to infrastructure as a service cloud offerings[1]. 
          
          <br><br>
 
        Amazon was an early leader in the cloud services industry and was one of the first large enterprise organisations to develop offerings in the fields Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS). Launching as early as 2006 with the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud service, which aimed to provide users with affordability and scalability for computing tasks that was impossible to achieve through traditional methods[2]. 
          
          <br><br>

        As Amazons market share grew, so did its competition. With Google joining the market in 2008 with the launch of their App Engine framework, a toolkit for hosting web applications from Google's existing data centres.[3] 2008 also saw the launch of the Microsoft Azure cloud platform as their response to the existing competition within the market[4].   
          
          <br><br>
          
        The current leaders within the cloud market maintain a focus on providing Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS) offerings that aim to replace traditional on-prem server-based solutions. These services are offered through a pay as you go subscription that provide easy access to cloud-hosted database, compute, AI, IoT, as well as additional services such as analytics and virtual computing. Through the use of these services smaller organisations and start-ups can quickly set up a database or host a web application without first having to implement their own servers or infrastructure. Organisations choosing to utilise these cloud services can also expect to see reduced costs, along with dramatically increased scalability and reduced risk of impacts to business continuity[5]. 
          
          <br><br>
          
        The increased growth and development within the public cloud sector is enabling many industries to better utilise technology to fit needs specific to their industries. IBM has been utilising a cloud-based approach to assist in mapping the human genome in an effort to better understand different types of cancer.[6] With the increased scalability provided by these cloud based services, businesses are no longer limited by their local infrastructure. 
          
          <br><br>

The global API market is also expected to grow at a rate of over 20% per year as the increased connectivity provided by cloud infrastructure allows information to be shared and distributed globally[7]. This will allow for increased integration between applications and allow organisations to utilise tools and datasets created by other entities, meaning that start-ups can get off the ground faster than ever before, and scale in ways never seen before.   
          
          <br><br>
          
          Since the launch of the initial cloud offerings from Amazon, there has been increased research within the company to further development the core server-side technologies responsible for their success. In 2019 Amazon finally announced they would be shifting away from Intel’s x86 processor architecture in favour of their own proprietary Graviton2 processors. These new ARM based processors promised 40% better performance from comparable x86-based instances for 20% less cost[8]
          
          <br><br>
          
          
          As technical development continues into cloud server technology and the large enterprise organisations continue to fight for market share, the consumers and organisations using their services will reap the benefits of any improvements. Consumers typically have seen increased performance and reduced costs as technology develops. 
          
          <br><br>
          

IoT and artificial intelligence are also expected to boom within the next decade as the cloud technologies they rely on continue to grow and develop. Mobile devices typically require both time and processing power to analyse large unstructured data sets, however with the power of the cloud and AI, devices will be able to utilise external processing power to perform advances tasks.[9] 
          
          <br><br>
          
          One of the biggest challenges that organisations face today is the process of adopting new technologies to suit their needs. Many organizations invest in expensive technology infrastructure that ties up their resources and requires large capital expenditure. 
          
          <br><br>

However, with cloud technology, it is possible to subscribe to services that are tailored to specific needs of the business. It also allows organisations to reduce their capital expenditure and shift over to an operational expenditure model and lets them pay only for the services they require at the time. In a recent survey of 1,300 companies, over 88% experienced cost savings after implementing cloud solutions. And 56% found there were additional benefits in making the move to the cloud [10]. 
          
          <br><br>
          
          Everyday people, that are the end users of any cloud-based services or products utilising the cloud will most likely be the most affected by further developments in the cloud industry. As IoT continues to grow and devices become more connected and reliant on the cloud, users will be able to do more than ever before.  
          
          <br><br>
          
          Any industries that utilise traditional in-house servers or local storage will continue to see cloud infrastructure influencing the way they do business. The technology conglomerate Cisco stated “By 2021, 94 percent of workloads and compute instances will be processed by cloud data centres with only six percent being processed by traditional data centres.”[11]. Given the rapid expansion of the public cloud, there has been massive demand for the skillsets supporting the 3 largest public cloud providers. Between 2018 and 2019 the job-seeker website Indeed.com saw Amazon AWS grow 21.07%, Microsoft Azure grow 30.59%, and Google Cloud by 40.87% in regards to job listings. This trend will most likely continue as more organisations make the switch to public cloud.
          
          <br><br>
          
          Consumer devices will continue to integrate further with the public cloud, and we will see our lives change as new technologies enable us meet virtually and more easily share information between ourselves. As aspiring IT professionals, we will also need to stay up to date with industry standards and continuously develop our understanding of these technologies. 
          
          <br><br>
          
          Having a keen interest in IT and wishing to work in the field of IT we may be required to learn and develop further understanding of the key cloud platforms and industry standard technologies that are used. To ensure we are competitive within the industry we will need to keep up to date with how these technologies work and understand how we can best utilise them ourselves and within the workplace. 
          
          <br><br>
          
          Friends and family will see the positive impacts of the cloud within the consumer devices and products they use. Hopefully this will allow them to stay more connected with each other, and live easier lives thanks to the power of the cloud.
