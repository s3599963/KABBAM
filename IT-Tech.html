        <h1>Cyber Security</h1>

        <p style="margin-top: 30px">
        What does it do? 

Cyber security uses preventative measures to limit system attacks or threats, theft of personal or sensitive data, malicious 
software, or disruption of online services. Through the implementation of threat management 
tools, teams of experienced professionals and knowledge of networks, software and hardware; systems may be stress tested 
(also known as penetration testing) by a hacker to gain insight to a system’s capability to withstand an attack. 
Not only does the cyber security sector aim to prevent these breaches it also, in a worst-case scenario, will immediately 
focus on the attack to stop and reduce the severity of the attack, adapt and learn from the incident when it 
occurs to then prevent it from reoccurring. 
        </p>
         <p style="margin-top: 30px">
        What is the state of the art of this new technology?  

The Cybersecurity industry has seen crucial progress in the struggle
           against online attacks using denial of service attacks (DoS), malicious
           software (Malware), data breaches and ransomware (to name a few.) Subsequent 
           advancements in deep learning & artificial intelligence (AI) and cloud 
           security will allow the management of these online threats to detect the 
           attacker before damage can be done or data is breached. [5] In addition 
           to this, Linux distributions like Red Hat and Kali have been used and developed
           by professionals in the industry. Red Hat and Kali are exceptional operating 
           systems as they have been around for a long time, the developers provide
           regular updates and have many built-in tools that are very powerful for 
           both sides of cybersecurity, the protection and malicious attacks.
           Considering these OS have been around for so long this also means 
           obtaining the training and skills are simple and easy to come by with many
           professionals and certifications available. [6] 
        </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 30px">
        What can be done now? With regards of what can be done now, currently Basic Cyber security
          systems include Passwords, controlling access, Firewalls, updating valid patches but more
          effective methods with security software and software that detects and monitors intrusion. [2] 

Additionally, the “ethical hacker” or systems admin would need be as educated about different breach
          methods, hacking methods, incident management tools and new technology. These tools, operating 
          systems, and extensive knowledge can be used to stress test and try varying methods to breach a system.
          These tests are often called pen testing (short for penetration testing.)

           How will this affect you? (300 words) In your daily life, how will this affect you? What will be different for you? How might this affect members of your family or your friends? 

This new technology will provide the general public and less tech savvy people with the ability to seamlessly maintain personal security and privacy with new and constantly improving technology such as 2-3 factor authentication, for example removing or mitigating the user generated risks like Easy to guess passwords, phishing links and leaked/misplaced information. [3] 

Whilst this is referring mainly to the general public it is also valuable for businesses and places where important, personal information or classified documents may be stored making the previously mentioned data significantly more secure but in conjunction with basic user based security like 2-3 factor authentication there is often hidden software or architecture in the background like data encryption Which keeps you and your family safer by putting another barrier between you and the person or program with malicious intent.  [4] 

This will affect everyone in a positive way my making the Internet of Things more and more secure for the average person whilst making it convenient and more personalised.

       What is likely to be able to do be done soon (say in the next 3 years)? 

The paper “Deep learning for cyber security intrusion detection: Approaches, datasets, and comparative study” 
          as published by Elsevier in the Journal of Information Security and Applications goes in depth regarding
          deep learning and AI’s involvement in the progression of cybersecurity. This fascinating paper presents the findings of a 
          “survey of deep learning approaches for cyber security intrusion detection, the datasets used, and a comparative study.” 

In order to keep the summary succinct there were ten deep learning approaches-based intrusion detection systems used to train the deep learning/AI include:
          deep neural network, feed forward deep neural network, recurrent neural network, convolutional neural network, restricted Boltzmann machine, deep
          belief network, deep auto-encoder, deep migration learning, self-taught learning, and replicator neural network.  


        </p>
           <p style="margin-top: 146px">
             What technological or other developments make this possible? 

The latest innovations in the cyber security and defence scene have been mainly in Artificial Intelligence & Deep learning 
             where it has been used in Two Factor Authentication to analyse logs, transitions and Realtime communications to 
             detect threats and activities that weren’t performed by the intended user. [1] 

With rising attacks of online platforms such as Twitter, Sony (Playstation Network), plus others. Internet and computer user’s 
             concerns for their security is more prevalent than ever. This has seen a shift in the marketing for online service like
             Dashlane (a secure vault for storing accounts and passwords) and VPNs such as NordVPN, ExpressVPN, or TunnelBear.
             Although these are considered mainstream or for personal use, we continue to see an increase in software and hardware development designed to protect 
             user's data, IP addresses, search history and geographical location.

        <p style="margin-top: 146px">
        What is the likely impact? (300 words) What is the potential impact of this development? What is likely to change? Which people will be most affected and how? Will this create, replace or make redundant any current jobs or technologies?  

Software such as VPNs have gained a lot of traction in the last few years with advertisements all over websites, ads on social media, and as sponsors or online content creators on YouTube and Twitch. This has meant more Internet users have been educated on the ways their personal data can be stolen. Additionally, the continuous development of these software and education of the dangers online could also inspire people interested in the sector to learn more and study up on the topic of cyber security. 

The most likely change is people purchasing these products, wanting to protect themselves and even advising the others to get these products. This could also change how people use the Internet and being mindful of how the sites they visit could record sensitive data. The IT industry could see a shift and other online platforms, like social media, increase their security measures like great two-factor authentication methods to protect their users as well. 

This will most likely affect the users of the Internet and the hackers. Now that users are more aware of hacks and chose to use this software, hackers will now need to put work into targeting these people differently or even focus their efforts more on Internet users that don’t use this software and aren’t as aware of online exposure. Consequently, students and industry professionals may become interested in this sector and decide to study it. 

I believe this is a great step in the direction of people wanting to know more about cyber security either through wanting to educate others of the dangers on the Internet. The fact that these software are being developed and more people are using them could also mean that the teams behind this software will require more staff to keep the integrity of the software and possibly improve the features and its functionality.

          <h1>Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies </h1>
         
        Enter Bitcoin 

Quietly sprouting from the smouldering ash of the 2008 financial crisis was the pseudonymous publication of the Bitcoin whitepaper. Removing intermediary involvement of third-party financial institutions, the whitepaper detailed a vision of a global peer to peer electronic currency stored on a distributed ledger known as a blockchain [1]. A public distributed ledger/ blockchain records data and information regarding transactions, falsifying and editing past blocks of data is near impossible thanks to the buff cryptography that securing the chain. While Bitcoin isn’t the earliest conception of a blockchain, it is arguably the most recognizable.  

Enter Ethereum 

By 2013, Bitcoin had succeeded through its experimental phase, rooting itself as a decentralized electronic cash system averaging 40,000 to 60,000 daily transactions [2]. The next step in crypto currencies advancing beyond digital cash sought the satiation of sophisticated contracts and digital agreements. The Ethereum whitepaper published by Vitalik Buterin in 2013 proposed a global, distributed, open sourced computational platform that would facilitate the creation and environment for smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps) to be written and stored on [3]. Smart contracts are computer programs equipped with programmable logic that can fulfil execution based on parameters being met, negating the ever-present risk of relying on separate parties to follow through with their commitments that are naturally tied within traditional contracts that are not performed in trustless execution environments (TEEs).   One can think of Ethereum as the iPhone and the decentralized applications as iPhone apps. Now that smart contracts have come into fruition there dwells the conundrum of reliably connecting trusted external data inputs with the parameters of a smart contract because blockchains are limited to communicating with themselves and cannot interact with external data sources, which in 80 precent of cases are essential to trigger the consequences of a smart contract in real time, e.g. did the parcel arrive, what was the quantity rainfall in a specific location, what is the price of gold per ounce. This is commonly known as the oracle problem, or the god protocol [4].
