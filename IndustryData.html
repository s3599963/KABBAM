        <h1>Industry Data</h1>
        <br>
        <p>The industry data supplied by Burning Glass was a very interesting insight to the IT industry regarding job roles and the skills requested for successful candidates to possess. The ideal job titles of the group IT manager, software engineering program manager, software developer flight control, mid-level penetration test, cyber security analyst, front end developer. According to the burning glass results, Andrew’s ideal job as an IT manager is a very similar job to a systems administrator and it ranks in the top ten roles with a total of 681 advertised roles between <br><strong>March 24th 2017 and March 23rd 2018</strong><sub>[2]</sub>. What was surprising was cyber security roles like the ideal roles of Benjamin as penetration tester and Kieren as cyber security analyst was that neither of them were found in the top ranked listing nor were there any roles similar to either of these ideal job roles.</p>

        <p>Through analysis of the top ranked generic skills from the burning glass data<sub>[1]</sub>, it was seen the most common required skills in the group were: problem solving, team work/collaboration, communication skills, planning, writing, and time management. All these generic skills are found in the top 6 of greatest in demand by employers. From the knowledge gathered from this it can be assumed that the team’s ideal roles require a high level of business and people understanding with senior management traits in order to be chosen in recruitment and successful while in that role.</p>

        <p>However, when it came to IT-specific skills, the top 6 most common in the group were found throughout the results. The top 6 most common IT-specific skills in the group are: software engineering, git, javascript, python, building relationships, and project management<sub>[3]</sub>. These skills are all found in the top half of the burning glass results and suggest they are highly sought after and required by potential employers. Regarding the IT-specific skills results provided by burning glass the three highest ranked skills that are not in team required skillset are: business process, SAP and business management.</p>

        <p>After having analysed the results from burning glass and our own research of generic and IT specific skills, the following are the team’s thoughts regarding their ideal jobs in the IT industry. </p>

        <p><strong>Aiden (Software Engineering Program Manager):</strong><i><font color="gray"> “”</font></i></p>
        <p><strong>Andrew (IT Manager):</strong><i><font color="gray"> “”</font></i></p>
        <p><strong>Benedict (Software Developer Flight Control):</strong><i><font color="gray"> “I knew prior to scanning the burning glass data that my chosen dream job was incredibly niche, nevertheless my stance still remains. If anything, the scarcity mutes any other distractions and provides me a target completely hone towards.”</font></i></p>
        <p><strong>Benjamin (Mid-Level Penetration Tester):</strong><i><font color="gray"> “After looking at the Burning Glass data I’ve realised how high the salaries are for penetration testing and I can now see that the skill level required to gain a good position at a mid-level may take me longer to achieve than I previously thought. It’s also clear that the number of jobs that are or become available for penetration testing are faw fewer than I thought, and I will need to focus on networking with people in industry and looking at lateral entry positions to the penetration tester job market such as IT Helpdesk Support Level 3 into Cybersecurity focused Support positions and then on to Penetration Testing”</font></i></p>
        <p><strong>Kieren (Cyber Security Analyst):</strong><i><font color="gray"> “Considering the data from burning glass this has not changed my opinion of my ideal job, in fact, it has made me want to get the job more knowing the skills that I will need to achieve the exciting process required to get there and in the role.”</font></i></p>
        <p><strong>Marcus (Front End Developer):</strong><i><font color="gray"> “After looking at the Burning Glass data I have not changed my opinion. I believe this data has highlighted that I am well on the path to this ideal job, and that I have some existing skill in most of the required areas. I think with further development in these key IT skills I will genuinely be an asset to any organisation I wish to work at.”</font></i></p>
