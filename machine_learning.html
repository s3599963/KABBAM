        <h1>Machine Learning</h1>
        <p style="margin-top: 30px">
        Machine learning can be split into 4 different sub-categories in which they would be - Supervised learning, Unsupervised learning, Semi Supervised learning and Reinforcement learning.  
          
        <br><br>

        The most popular and widely used example that incorporates different sub-categories of machine learning would have to be your favourite search engine, be it the popular Google and Bing or the lesser known OneSearch or DuckDuckGo. They have a central database that is consistently being automatically altered however still having the option for personal input and monitoring where needed. This enables the best search results for what you are specifically looking for as opposed to throwing random options to the user. This also enables the user to tailor the request further in which creates a more personalised experience. With capabilities as they currently are for machine learning, we can easily database generalised information and have artificially enhanced actions in which any additional information can be automatically sorted and dispersed into specific areas where required. 

          <br><br>
          
      Given my personal experience with a form of machine learning (CNC Press Brake work) I can attest for their level of machine learning as with machines that I have used requires a small amount of manual input however the machine then takes over. This alone is proof of the advancements in the field itself as prior to this, all bending of steel was done in a hand press, the procedure for this was completely manual. The machine I used mainly was manual set up and input of measurements required, input material and fold, check angle and input the angle that you received. After you have input all the first run measurements it becomes clockwork, the machine takes over and does absolutely all calculations to ensure the fold is correct. The machine then saves the input string as to ensure that you can do a job of thousands of parts.  
          
          <br><br>

      The technology behind machine learning itself can be broken down to – Data Models, Algorithms, Datasets, Feature Extraction, Tunable Machine Learning and Advanced Threats. In a short reflection of all these components, Data Models are trained inputs of data that create an algorithm that it can then use to learn further data strings. Algorithms receive and analyse any data that has been input through a system and learn how to better optimise the experience. A dataset is a collection of instances, generally there is a need multiple datasets. Feature extraction is a generalised way of saying that there are different methods for constructing variable combinations. Advanced threats have been a challenge for securing Information Technology as well as Operational Technology, this is due to their capability of flying under the radar and staying undetected for an extended period of time. 
          
          <br><br>

      As machine learning gets older and older, the doors open up a little bit further and we are able to see more of the limitless opportunities for growth. As of 2016, the machine learning market was around 1.03 Billion USD however is expected to skyrocket to roughly 8.81 Billion USD before 2022. 
          
          <br><br>

      Within the next few years you can expect to see a rather rapid increase in user generated features and a more personalised experience as the data options will grow. The further that we push coding the more in depth the possibilities will be. 
          
          <br><br>

      In the manufacturing industry alone, the advancements in artificial intelligence has been extensive. Ranging from standard steel sheets being moved from machine to machine automatically to “robot welders” which will do a welder's job however be more reliable. When it comes to the process of folding parts, AI is already used quite heavily as there are options to add on a software which enables the use of a robotic arm to completely take out the human element where danger is applied. 
          
          <br><br>


     Looking into this manufacturing side of machine learning again, it is safe to say that in future a lot of your more “high risk”. Removing the human error in the in most cases can prevent a whole range of injuries therefore ensuring that the people that work in this field can continue and also would be driving down the amount of mistakes being made due to human error. This would mean that more businesses would likely be a little further profitable.  
          
          <br><br>

    As all databases that incorporate machine learning, there is always the possibility for things to go horribly wrong however at the same speed that we are progressing, we are also building on our knowledge of how to combat all possibilities. Meaning all the while we are focusing on advancing, inadvertently we are building our defences to cover the new progression we have just made. 
          
          <br><br>

    If in the near future, we were looking down the barrel of “medical artificial intelligence”. We could have the capability to utilise machines that could read a specific symptom list and from blood work and heart rate of a patient to list several possible illnesses to help narrow down exactly what is wrong with the patient.  
          
          <br><br>

    There will be a number of jobs that get modified to accommodate the use of machine learning in which there will no longer be a need for the human operator of certain machines is now working as a supervisor, ensuring that the machine is working as intended. This doesn’t mean that all jobs will change, there is still much to be learned about the possibilities of machine learning in which we haven’t tapped into just yet.
          
          <br><br>

    In my daily life, advancements in machine learning will enable online searches to be more accurate to exactly what I am after as opposed to throwing the odd one or two things that have no correlation to anything I have searched in previous.  
          
          <br><br>

    While looking down the barrel of manufacturing, I personally have seen a lot of changes in the field in more recent years. There is no longer any manual unloading of sheets out of a laser cutting machine as there are automated systems to remove the possibility for injury and while at the same time increasing production. Welders will mostly be phased out due to the sheer fact that, if a robot can do it better and quicker. Why would someone pay that extra money when they could just pay you to supervise the machine instead? People in storeman type rolls can be somewhat spared from the ever-expanding field as they are required to understand just what is in their possession and would need to do consistent checking of systems. As for my previous experience, the job I used to work would be completely overhauled by artificial intelligence. I would no longer be the person handling all material in and out of the machine, in fact I would only be ensuring the machine picked up the sheet the right way and didn’t miss a step, I would become a robot supervisor. In a medical field having the opportunity to have a generalised second opinion and as opposed to a doctor missing something and nearly having a patient pass. This would just add that little bit of extra buffer area in between human error and something absolutely devastating.
