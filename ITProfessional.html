Our group decided the best way to gain insights into the IT industry would be through an interview conducted with an IT professional. We came together as a team to discuss any existing contacts we had as individuals, that may have been able to assist us with completing this group activity. Both Kieren and Marcus mentioned they had connections with some current IT professionals from their prior work experiences, so we decided to reach out to both to schedule an interview. 
 
One of our potential interviewees let us know they would be unable to assist us, but we were lucky enough to get the go ahead from our other proposed candidate. 
 
We originally planned to assemble the whole team together in a video conference to hold the interview, however we encountered scheduling issues that prevented us from doing so. 
Collectively we decided it would be best to send through a set of questions to be answered via e-mail.

          <p><strong> Q&A with an IT professional </strong>
         
<p><strong> 1. Can you introduce yourself? Tell us where you currently work? And what your role is? </strong></p>

Sure!  
 
Hello, I'm Dan Griffin, I'm the Salesforce Team Lead at carsales.com ltd.  
 
I'm responsible for the Salesforce CRM platform here at carsales. And I oversee the team of Developers, Analysts and Admins who support, maintain and extend the platform.  

Projects and features we work on usually centre around internal processes and integrations, such as 'Order to Cash', integrating the sales process into the finance platform, invoicing etc. Or are migration and change projects such as onboarding a new business process, business area or acquired business onto centralised systems and processes. 
        </p>
      <p style="margin-top: 30px">
        <br><br> 

        <p><strong> 2. Please tell us about the industry you work in?  </strong> </p>

 
I would call it a Tech and Media business, 
 
At its core, carsales operates a variety of digital marketplaces, websites like carsales.com.au, bikesale.com.au, trucksales.com.au etc. and international marketplaces though interests in South Korea, and Latin America. 
Essentially consumers can view and enquire on inventory (eg: cars) that has been listed online by dealerships or individuals. 
 
Diving deeper it can get more complex as many adjacent opportunities are commercialised. Here are some examples: 

Proprietary software solutions are developed and sold to business customers eg: inventory management software for car dealerships 

Online advertising solutions are sold to other customers like manufactures and insurance companies or any company who may wish to advertise at people interested in ultimately making purchases through on of the sites 

Extensive datasets also get commercialised such as data on vehicle depreciation gets sold to banks to help them assess loans 
      </p>
    <p style="margin-top: 30px">
      <br><br> 

      <p><strong> 3. Do you use any specialist software or hardware within your role?  </strong> </p>

 
For our team we're on the salesforce.com CRM platform which is the market leading solution for a CRM. Quite a bit of tooling exists within the platform to support development, and it provides a 'declarative' development option, lots of platform functionality exists to support business operations too. 
    </p>
<p style="margin-top: 30px">
Other key pieces of software I use are: 

VS Code 

Github  

Jira //backlog and sprint management 

Confluence // wiki for docs 

Slack //company-wide instant messaging 

Zoom //yep 

Microsoft Office suite including teams 

Lucidchart //for process mapping and diagrams 
and I personally use photoshop for mock-ups and as a stand in for a whiteboard sessions since covid 

The hardware I’m using is pretty standard: laptop, dock, big screen I also run a little Wacom tablet for drawing and writing on things.

          <p><strong> 4. Who are all the different people or departments you interact with in your work? 
            </strong> </p>
<br><br> 

Yikes, feels like everyone!  

As the central platform for capturing all interactions with business customers our team is often right in the middle of any business process that involves Sales or business customers in some way. 
This means we're always engaging with all the commercial (sales) teams, finance, product managers, marketing and people at all levels of seniority from our internal end users who are the actual sales and support people doing work on platform to their management all the way up to senior management even including exec for large projects, resourcing and reporting. 
 
That’s before we even start doing development where we could be engaging with various development teams internally, 3rd party vendors or partner teams depending on the requirement. 
<p><strong> 5. Please tell us about your interactions with other IT professionals.   </strong>

 
We'll they're all on Zoom now and as a result too many meetings! 
 
Day to day we're having a mix of Zoom meetings, Slack as a messenger platform or email or communication on pieces of work as Jira comments for example. 
 
Project work is a bit more interesting;  
 
For a new project or feature we would have an initial discovery session which could be with a small or large group depending on the touchpoints it has so that the team 
 
Following this I will work with the team to break down the requirements into specific deliverable chunks (we're using agile methods so ideally to epic level at this stage) with the goal of having enough understanding of what is needed to deliver the piece of work to be able to provide an estimate of effort, this might involve some follow-up discussions with business or developers to clarify.  
 
(My preference is we have a real room with a whiteboard and cards to write on so we can take up a bunch of space and lay out the pieces of work on cardboard, tactile and visual and movable and not in front of a screen for a change of pace and focus) 
 
Following estimates there may be some liaison with other team leads and senior management to align priorities and timings if there are any identified dependency 
 
Assuming we're actually going to start the delivery phase, the pieces of work fall into regular agile ceremonies like standups, and the interactions around delivery become close knit between the delivery team, ideally face to face interaction which would be working discussions at desks or in a breakout room or at the moment even more zoom calls! Screenshares to work though specific problems, lots of diagrams.  
 
Also a bunch of side interactions facilitating UAT sessions, presenting progress back to stakeholders and getting regular feedback back into the team. 
Plus a bunch of team lead responsibilities so fortnightly (at least) catch ups 1:1 with team members where will be discussing work, goals, learning and development and any issues. 
        <p><strong> 6. Do you have any interactions with clients or investors?  </strong> </p>

 <br><br> 

Usually not, however the company is ASX listed so many reporting and audit requirements are driven by ASX obligations. 
We do often work with vendors but these type of interactions makes us the client 
<p><strong> 7. What aspects of your work do you spend most time on?  </strong></p>
<br><br> 

 
Most time is spent getting the new requirements and analysis of what the requirement actually is, getting it into the mix for prioritisation or not (and protecting the team from stakeholders trying to skip prioritisation) and translating the requirements into something the team can deliver on.  
So lots of time spent at the top of funnel of pieces of work, then also a focus on the delivery aspect, especially in the QA, UAT release steps. 
<p><strong> 8. Which do you find to be the most challenging aspect of your role?  </strong></p>
<br><br> 

 
Definitely needing to manage new requests from many different areas of the business wanting things from a limited team capacity and communicating capacity challenges and fighting to keep the workload of the team at a sustainable level.  
With everyone working remoting though COVID this is extra challenging because its instant messaging, email and zoom barrage and the resulting context switching is tough 
The delivery part can be fun and satisfying even if it sometimes gets complex! 
        <br><br> 

<p><strong>9. When you first started working in IT, did it differ from your expectations? 
   </strong></p>


My pathway is quite non-standard I would say. 
I career changed after graduating and practicing as a physiotherapist and took up work in an administrative role in the education sector, doing admin for Salesforce and a few LMS systems before really finding an affinity for the more technical side and becoming certified as a Salesforce administrator and learning platform development. 
 
So I would say I have grown into the IT role along the way, main difference from my expectation was how valuable a broad skillset is to a technology team and the wider business. Communication, problem solving, and presentation skills built outside of the IT industry definitely put me ahead of other candidates with more technical expertise in the initial roles. 
 <br><br> 

 <p><strong>10. Finally, do you have any advice for people wishing to enter the IT industry? 
   </strong></p>


Absolutely,  
 
(especially for people who are looking to enter the IT industry from some other industry) 

Grow where you are planted - The important thing is to be able to build skills wherever you are working currently, most businesses will be using some form of IT and they will nearly always be under-resourced, if your goal is to make a move into the IT space take steps to get exposure to the systems and processes in use by your employer. If you have zero scope to learn on the job, strongly consider moving to an employer who is more open to your learning  

System experts are in demand - I'm very biased as a Salesforce guy, but if you're looking to break into the industry there are key technologies used by businesses, you might even be using them as an end user right now. Experience in system as a user in a real business is putting you ahead of the school leaver 

Non-Technical skills matter (especially if supported by technical skills) - Being able to communicate, write, problem solve, understand busines processes, understand accounting, rock out in excel, make diagrams, do a sales pitch, cut together a training video... many many skills are relevant to industry and especially if you are also technically strong you're going to be able to add value to some fortunate company.  

Keep learning things!

        <p><strong> Reflection  </strong> </p>


 
Upon receiving our answers, we reflected as a group to see if the provided answers met our expectations or gave us with any valuable insights into the industry that we were unaware of. 
 
It was interesting to hear about Salesforce CRM and learn that there is an entire ecosystem of technically skilled administrators, developers and analysts utilising the cloud-based SaaS platform to provide value to different organisations. As a group we found it interesting that Dan did not outline much specialty tooling that was required for this job, our research into Salesforce showed us that the platform itself allowed for quite a lot of customisation without the need to code through ‘declarative’ programming, although coding could be used to further expand the platform. 

 

We were not too surprised when Dan expressed that he felt like he interacted with everyone in his job, we all assumed that given the importance of IT within most larger organisations that he would be heavily involved with other departments within the business. 

 

Knowing there are IT solutions and toolsets to assist with project management, it was interesting to hear that as an IT professional Dan preferred to work on project ideas physically in a room as it was more “tactile, visual, and movable”.   

 

From what Dan said it sounds like carsales has adapted well to Covid-19 with the adoption of Zoom and other technologies for online meetings and communications. Given the size of the organisation we expected they wouldn’t have been too affected by the transition to working from home and it seems this is the case. 

 

We also found it very interesting than Dan came from a non-IT background, working as a physiotherapist before transitioning without any formal qualification into the field of IT. We agreed that the combination of both technical and non-technical skills seemed to be most valuable for Dan when entering the field, and would probably be the most important aspect to most others seeking to enter an IT role. 

 

We found it very insightful to talk to someone working in an IT position, using technology we were not aware of, and working with stability during the difficult times that covid-19 has brought upon us. 
As a group we agreed that speaking to other professionals currently working in IT roles might be a great way to build industry connections and learn from people with real, lived experience.
